# A Sentiment Analysis on Skewed Product Reviews: Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream

This repository contains the source code for the sentiment analysis of Ben & Jerryâ€™s ice cream product reviews. The goal is to understand consumer opinions and improve product offerings by analyzing sentiment from user-generated content.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this study is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset) and includes various Ben & Jerry's ice cream products and their reviews.

## Methods
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
Due to the imbalance in the dataset, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to balance the data.

## Results
The inclusion of SVM in our study provided a comparison of different classification methods. Here are the results:

- Before data balancing, the models achieved the following accuracies:
   - Naive Bayes: 87.14%
   - Logistic Regression: 93.77%
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM): 95.23%
  
- After data balancing using SMOTE, the accuracies improved to:
  - Naive Bayes: 92.57%
  - Logistic Regression: 94.50%
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM): 95.36%

The results indicate that SVM consistently outperformed Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in both balanced and imbalanced data.
